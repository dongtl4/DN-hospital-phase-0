# DN-hospital-phase-0
Using gama platform to describe the outbreak of pandemic in hospital area. Currently work on phase 0 and will be merged with COMOKIT building.  
Current issues:  
- Walk through wall: I made a graph network handly but the people agents won't move as I expected, they remain staying at their location  
- Data input: current data input is a sketch draw handly, it need to resize to fit with reality
- Epidemiology: because the target of phase 0's model is create daily routine of people in hospital and from that show to medical expert and took their advice, the epidemiology of model still very simple
- The model right now can't opperate with COMOKIT building yet, for example, the activities of people in COMOKIT building is a species, in this model they're just some actions of people's subspecies
